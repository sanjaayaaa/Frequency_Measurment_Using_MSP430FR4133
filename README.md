# Frequency_Measurment_Using_MSP430FR4133
This project is to measure frequency of digital pulses in frequency range of 1KHz to 200KHz 

To achive this task unknow signal is given to Pin 1.6 which is CCIxA  of Timer A0. <br />
Measured Frequecny is sent to LCD .<br /> A sample signal of 32Khz is also generated at pin 8.1 so as to test the working of a our code.
